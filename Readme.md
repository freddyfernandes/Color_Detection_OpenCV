Color Detection with OpenCV
This short project uses OpenCV to detect yellow objects through a webcam feed and draws a bounding box around them. 
The key aspect of this project is the consideration of the hue value for color detection.

Dependencies
OpenCV
NumPy
Pillow (PIL)

Important Note
Press 'q' to exit the webcam feed.
Future Scope
This project can be extended to detect and label objects of various colours. 
Consider experimenting with different colour thresholds and adding object labels for a more versatile application.

Feel free to explore and customize the code for your specific use case!
